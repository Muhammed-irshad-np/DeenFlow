# 🕌 Islamic App – Design & UX Rules

## 1. Core Design Philosophy

This app is NOT:
- A game
- A dopamine trap
- A guilt machine
- A cluttered marketplace

This app IS:
- A calm spiritual companion
- A daily-use utility
- Minimal, respectful, and trustworthy
- Emotionally peaceful

Design must reflect humility, sincerity, and clarity.

No flashy animations.
No loud gradients.
No aggressive engagement tricks.

---

## 2. Emotional Tone

Every screen must feel:

- Calm
- Clean
- Focused
- Non-distracting
- Spiritually grounding

If a screen feels "busy" — remove elements.

---

## 3. Color System

### Primary Colors
- Deep Emerald (#0F3D2E)
- Dark Teal (#123C3A)
- Warm Off-White (#F6F4EF)

### Accent
- Gold (used very sparingly for highlights)
- Soft Green for success states

### Forbidden
- Neon colors
- Red warning tones for missed prayers
- Overuse of gold
- Over-saturated gradients

Dark mode must be default.

---

## 4. Typography Rules

### Arabic Text
- Must use proper Uthmani script
- No distortion
- No decorative fonts
- Large readable size
- Generous line spacing

### English / Other Languages
- Clean sans-serif
- High readability
- No condensed fonts
- Minimum 16px for body text

Never shrink Quran text to fit UI.
UI adapts to Quran — not the opposite.

---

## 5. Layout Principles

Every screen follows:

- Clear top hierarchy
- Single primary action
- Maximum 2 secondary actions
- No more than 5 core elements per view

White space is mandatory.

---

## 6. Navigation Structure

Bottom Navigation (Max 5 tabs):

1. Home
2. Quran
3. Prayer
4. Tracker
5. Profile

No hidden deep nesting.
Max 3 levels deep.

User should never feel lost.

---

## 7. Quran Screen Rules

Absolutely:
- No ads
- No popups
- No overlay banners
- No subscription interruption

Quran reading must be sacred space.

Audio controls minimal.
Translation toggle simple.
Tafsir in expandable section.

Scrolling must feel smooth and frictionless.

---

## 8. Prayer Screen Rules

- Show next prayer prominently
- Subtle countdown
- No fear-based messaging
- No red missed indicators

If prayer missed:
Display gentle reminder:
"You can still make it up 🤍"

Never shame the user.

---

## 9. Gamification Rules

Allowed:
- Streak counters
- Progress rings
- Monthly summary
- Soft milestone celebrations

Not allowed:
- Leaderboards
- Public comparison
- Competitive ranking
- Manipulative urgency
- "Your Imaan is dropping" type messages

Progress is private.

---

## 10. Notifications UX

Tone:
Encouraging, never guilt-driven.

Example:
✔️ "It's time for Maghrib. May your prayer bring peace."
❌ "You missed Asr again."

Max 5 notifications per day.
User must control all notifications.

---

## 11. Ramadan Mode UX

When Ramadan is active:

- Slight gold accent addition
- Special Ramadan dashboard
- Daily checklist
- Night mode default

Remove after Ramadan automatically.

---

## 12. Performance Rules

App must:
- Launch under 2 seconds
- Work offline for Quran
- Cache prayer times
- Smooth scroll (60fps)

Spiritual apps cannot feel laggy.

---

## 13. Privacy UX

- No unnecessary permissions
- Location explained clearly
- No background tracking
- Clear privacy statement

Trust > Growth hacks.

---

## 14. Premium UX Rules

- No hard paywalls
- No blocking worship features
- Premium only enhances, never restricts

Subscription screen must:
- Explain value clearly
- No countdown timers
- No fake urgency

---

## 15. Micro-Interactions

Allowed:
- Soft haptic feedback
- Gentle fade transitions
- Subtle scale animation

Not allowed:
- Bounce animations
- Loud celebration effects
- Confetti explosions

---

## 16. Accessibility

- Text scaling support
- High contrast option
- Adjustable Quran font size
- Offline mode support

---

## 17. Design Review Checklist

Before merging UI:

- Is it calm?
- Is it respectful?
- Is it distraction-free?
- Is it simple?
- Would this feel appropriate inside a masjid?

If answer is no → redesign.

---

## Final Principle

The design should feel like:

"A quiet masjid in your pocket."
